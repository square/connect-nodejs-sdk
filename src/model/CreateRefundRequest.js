/**
 * Constructs a new <code>CreateRefundRequest</code>.
 * Defines the body parameters that can be included in a request to the [CreateRefund](#endpoint-createrefund) endpoint.  Deprecated - recommend using [RefundPayment](#endpoint-refunds-refundpayment)
 * @alias module:model/CreateRefundRequest
 * @class
 * @param idempotencyKey {String} A value you specify that uniquely identifies this refund among refunds you've created for the tender.  If you're unsure whether a particular refund succeeded, you can reattempt it with the same idempotency key without worrying about duplicating the refund.  See [Idempotency keys](#idempotencykeys) for more information.
 * @param tenderId {String} The ID of the tender to refund.  A ``Transaction`` has one or more `tenders` (i.e., methods of payment) associated with it, and you refund each tender separately with the Connect API.
 * @param amountMoney {module:model/Money} The amount of money to refund.  Note that you specify the amount in the __smallest denomination of the applicable currency__. For example, US dollar amounts are specified in cents. See [Working with monetary amounts](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-monetary-amounts) for details.  This amount cannot exceed the amount that was originally charged to the tender that corresponds to `tender_id`.
