/**
 * Constructs a new <code>BatchUpsertCatalogObjectsRequest</code>.
 * 
 * @alias module:model/BatchUpsertCatalogObjectsRequest
 * @class
 * @param idempotencyKey {String} A value you specify that uniquely identifies this request among all your requests. A common way to create a valid idempotency key is to use a Universally unique identifier (UUID).  If you're unsure whether a particular request was successful, you can reattempt it with the same idempotency key without worrying about creating duplicate objects.  See [Idempotency](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/basics/api101/idempotency) for more information.
 * @param batches {Array.<module:model/CatalogObjectBatch>} A batch of CatalogObjects to be inserted/updated atomically. The objects within a batch will be inserted in an all-or-nothing fashion, i.e., if an error occurs attempting to insert or update an object within a batch, the entire batch will be rejected. However, an error in one batch will not affect other batches within the same request.  For each object, its `updated_at` field is ignored and replaced with a current [timestamp](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-dates), and its `is_deleted` field must not be set to `true`.  To modify an existing object, supply its ID. To create a new object, use an ID starting with `#`. These IDs may be used to create relationships between an object and attributes of other objects that reference it. For example, you can create a CatalogItem with ID `#ABC` and a CatalogItemVariation with its `item_id` attribute set to `#ABC` in order to associate the CatalogItemVariation with its parent CatalogItem.  Any `#`-prefixed IDs are valid only within a single atomic batch, and will be replaced by server-generated IDs.  Each batch may contain up to 1,000 objects. The total number of objects across all batches for a single request may not exceed 10,000. If either of these limits is violated, an error will be returned and no objects will be inserted or updated.
