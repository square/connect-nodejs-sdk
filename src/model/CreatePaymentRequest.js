/**
 * Constructs a new <code>CreatePaymentRequest</code>.
 * Creates a payment from the source (nonce, card on file, etc.)  The &#x60;PAYMENTS_WRITE_ADDITIONAL_RECIPIENTS&#x60; OAuth permission is required to enable application fees.  For more information, see [Payments and Refunds Overview](/payments-api/overview).  For information about application fees in a payment, see [Collect Fees](/payments-api/take-payments-and-collect-fees).
 * @alias module:model/CreatePaymentRequest
 * @class
 * @param sourceId {String} The ID for the source of funds for this payment.  This can be a nonce generated by the Payment Form or a card on file made with the Customers API.
 * @param idempotencyKey {String} A unique string that identifies this CreatePayment request. Keys can be any valid string but must be unique for every CreatePayment request.  Max: 45 characters  See [Idempotency keys](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/basics/api101/idempotency) for more information.
 * @param amountMoney {module:model/Money} The amount of money to accept for this payment, not including `tip_money`.  Must be specified in the smallest denomination of the applicable currency. For example, US dollar amounts are specified in cents. See [Working with monetary amounts](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-monetary-amounts) for details.  The currency code must match the currency associated with the business that is accepting the payment.
