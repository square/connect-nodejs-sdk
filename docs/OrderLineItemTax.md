# SquareConnect.OrderLineItemTax

### Description

Represents a tax that applies to one or more line item in the order.  Fixed-amount, order-scoped taxes are distributed across all non-zero line item totals. The amount distributed to each line item is relative to the amount the item contributes to the order subtotal.

For &#x60;LINE_ITEM&#x60; scoped taxes, the tax will only apply to line items with references in their &#x60;applied_taxes&#x60; field.  This field is immutable. To change the scope, you must delete the tax and re-add it as a new tax. See [OrderLineItemTaxScope](#type-orderlineitemtaxscope) for possible values | [optional]
