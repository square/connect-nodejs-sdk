**name** | **String** | The discount&#39;s name. | [optional] 
**type** | **String** | The type of the discount. If it is created by API, it would be either &#x60;FIXED_PERCENTAGE&#x60; or &#x60;FIXED_AMOUNT&#x60;.

See [OrderLineItemDiscountType](#type-orderlineitemdiscounttype) for possible values. | [optional] 
**percentage** | **String** | The percentage of the tax, as a string representation of a decimal number. A value of &#x60;7.25&#x60; corresponds to a percentage of 7.25%.  The percentage won&#39;t be set for an amount-based discount. | [optional] 
**amount_money** | [**Money**](Money.md) | The total monetary amount of the applicable discount. If it is at order level, it is the value of the order level discount.

**applied_money** | [**Money**](Money.md) | The amount of discount actually applied to this line item.  Represents the amount of money applied to a line item as a discount When an amount-based discount is at order-level, this value is different from &#x60;amount_money&#x60; because the discount is distributed across the line items. | [optional]
